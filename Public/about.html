<p>I am a language enthusiast with a passion for exploring new cultures. Recently returned from Mexico, I am excited to start my new career in UX Design. When I'm not working, I love to go on walks with my husband of 17 years and travel to new destinations. My love of languages and travel keeps me busy and inspired. I have two cats, Suki and Sassy, keep me company at home. I am known among my friends for my compassion and empathy. I am excited to bring my unique perspective and skills to UX and make a positive impact in the world.
